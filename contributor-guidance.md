# Student Contributing Guide

## Getting Started

If IOOS is included as a GSoC mentoring organization for the year (typically announced in late February per the [GSoC program timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline), we invite interested contributors to apply to and of the projects listed in our project ideas list, linked from the [README](https://github.com/ioos/gsoc/blob/main/README.md). 

If you find a a project you feel you can tackle, reach out to the mentors to start a conversation about the project and to share your ideas.  

Some prospective contributors comment in the project idea GitHub issue directly, and this is OK to do to begin a dialog with mentors, however we discourage you from sharing any detailed ideas that you have in GitHub issue comments, as there's always a risk of plagiarism by other applicants in an open forum such as GitHub.  

We ask mentors to include an email address for at least one mentor in each project idea; please instead reach out via email to mentor(s) to discuss any specific ideas you're considering or plans you have for your proposal.

Additionally, if the project idea you're intersted in includes links to existing background issues in the project's code repository, you can read up on those, and, if you're able to, submit a PR to demonstrate your ability.  Some projects might tag open issues as suitable for GSoC as a way to identify more manageable issues for potential new contributors to address.  Feel free to tackle any of those if you are able as they'll allow mentors to assess your ability firsthand. 

**Further Background:** 
* [The opensource guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) has a good introduction how to start contributing to open source projects.


### Do I have the experience to apply?

The answer is generally: **Yes**.
Note that our organization values creativity, intelligence and enthusiasm above specific knowledge of the libraries or algorithms we use.
We think that a motivated students who are willing to learn are more valuable than anything else.

The [GSoC Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/am-i-good-enough#) gives a good overview of this part for GSoC.

## Applying to Google Summer of Code & IOOS

To get an idea for the IOOS Data Management and Cyberinfrastructure (DMAC) community (the overarching community from which most of our GSoC mentors and projects are drawn from), visit the 'ioos_tech' Google Group: https://groups.google.com/g/ioos_tech.

### Proposal template

We provide a an application/proposal template (in markdown) you can use as a reference or adapt for your personal application:

**https://github.com/ioos/gsoc/blob/main/proposal-template.md**  

Please include at a minimum each section in the proposal template in your application.  It is fine to reformat or reorder sections, and/or to submit an application in PDF format with diagrams, images, or code examples.  A complete application should include information for all of the sections and should have all of the placeholder information filled in.

### What makes a good GSoC proposal?

An ideal GSoC proposal should include the following:
1. A detailed, descriptive title
2. Personal Information, including contact info, timezone
3. Link to a **code contribution**, such as a PR, you've made previously
4. Full description of your proposed project, including timeline and planned deliverables (see the [proposal-template.md](https://github.com/ioos/gsoc/blob/main/proposal-template.md) for a recommended format)
5. Your schedule during the GSoC period and any prior committments that might affect your availability (school exams, other work committments, travel, etc)

### During the application phase

We usually favor students that show regular communication with mentors during the application period and are able to demonstrate a clear understanding of the challenge proposed in the project idea within their proposal.  In some cases, mentors may include existing GitHub issues or other references within their code that students can use to both understand the software and, in some cases, demonstrate they have a good chance to succeed in addressing the problem presented in the project idea.  

*These tips are here to help with your application. They are not required.*

- Have you communicated with the organization's mentors during the application period?
- Have you communicated with the community?
- Did you reference projects you coded WITH links to repos or provided code?
- Did you provide methods for mentors to contact you?
- Did you state which project you are applying for and why you believe you will be successful in completing the project?
- Did you share your proposed project plan with mentor(s) prior to the close of the application period to give them the opportunity to give feedback or ask you questions?
- Does your project plan clearly state the steps you will take during GSoC to address the goals or challenges in the proposed project? 
- Did you create a pull request on the existing code?
- Did you continue communication until accepted students are announced?
- Do you have time for GSoC? This is a paid job! State that you have time in your motivation letter, and list other commitments!
- Does you application describe what motivates you to work on this project, and, how your involvement in GSoC and this project in particular furthers your career goals?

### Submitting your application

Submit your completed application to the Google Summer of Code website directly, following all of the guidelines.  This is the only way an applications will be accepted for GSoC.
