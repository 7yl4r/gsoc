An ideal GSoC proposal should include the following:
1. A detailed, descriptive title
2. Personal Information, including contact info, timezone
3. Link to a **code contribution**, such as a PR, you've made previously
4. Full description of your proposed project, including timeline and planned deliverables
5. Your schedule during the GSoC period and any prior committments that might affect your availability (school exams, other work committments, travel, etc)

Example GSoC proposal template:


#  Title 

## Personal Info
1. Name 
2. Contact Info (email, phone, etc.)
3. Country, Timezone
4. GitHub handle, LinkedIn or other professional profile
5. School/University, concentration & expected graduation date
6. Link to a resume (if you want)

## About Me
Short introduction to you and what your interests and goals are, both with GSoC and otherwise.  What are your goals for participating in GSoC in relation to your career?

## Abstract

Short description of your project, 5-10 sentences.
Please **DO NOT** copy the project idea text here!

## Why this project?

What interests you in this GSoC project and our organization?
Note that this part is **very** important to show your motivation!

## Prior Development Experience

Do you have code on GitHub?  Share your prior development experience that qualifies you for GSoC and for the project you're applying for.  
List examples of your previous code contributions: to other open source projects, personal projects, or coding projects for academic studies that are publicly-visible.  
If you've already submitted code in the form of a PR to the project or organization that you're applying for for GSoC, link to that here to ensure mentors make the connection with your application!

## Project Details

### Technical Description

More detailed description of your project.
**Should** include all technical details of the projects for example:
- the libraries involved,
- the languages and techniques you will use,
- some pieces of the code you want to change,
-  links to literature you used during the research,
-  etc.

For this section, it is important to show if you had previous conversations with your mentors and have a sufficient understanding of the problem and a plan to address it during your project.

### Community Bonding Period

This phase is to get to know the community better and to prepare to start working on your project once the coding period begins.
Check that your work environment is set up, and that you can access all the necessary code, data, or other prerequisites for your project.
This time should also be used to discuss your project in more detail with your mentors and, with their assistance, introduce it to the broader developer community. 

Describe what you plan to do during the community bonding period and how you'd like to communicate with your potential mentors during this time, and anything you'd ask from your mentors in the way of support during this period to get you and your project up to speed for the coding period.

### Schedule of Deliverables

Here you should list your planned activities for the coding period, ideally on a weekly basis, and any specific milestones you plan to work towards in the schedule.  You can break down the coding period into different periods if you prefer (e.g. every two weeks), provided that you set specific targets for each phase and describe them clearly. Each target should be split into sub tasks with time estimates.

#### **Phase 1**
* **Week 1**
* **Week 2**
* **Week 3**
* **Week 4**
* **Week 5**
* **Week 6**

Mid-point: List deliverables at the mid-way point, in addition to any specified during the week-by-week work breakdown above..  

#### **Phase 2**
* **Week 7**
* **Week 8**
* **Week 9**
* **Week 10**
* **Week 11**  *Note: GSoC requires a final write up is submitted that your mentors will review in order to evaluate your work.  It's strongly advised that you share your writeup with your mentors prior to the due date so they can give feedback.  Consider planning to finish most of your coding by this week to ensure it can be merged/accepted and to focus on writing the report.*
* **Week 12**

#### **Final Week**
End of the standard GSoC coding period.  List the final planned deliverables for your project here.

At this stage your project should be completed and your code should already have been submitted to your organization, final report written, reviewed, and submitted via the GSoC website.  

_**Please Note:** We ask our GSoC contributors to produce a final writeup summarizing their work prior to completion of GSoC.  This can often be based on your final report or, if you prefer, can be a more narrative-style summary of your experience with GSoC (lessons learned, challenges, highlights, etc).  The writeup should be posted either on a blogging platform where links tend to persist reliably (e.g. Medium, Hashnode, ?), or, if preferred, directly as a markdown-formatted GitHub gist.  Please avoid personal GitHub Pages sites as we've found those to be less persistent (see our previous year's contributors' posts for dead link examples).  See IOOS' 2024 GSoC [project results page](https://github.com/ioos/gsoc/blob/main/2024/project-results.md) for example contributor writeups._

## Additional Background/Logistics

Please provide brief answers to the following questions: 
* What is your preferred method to communicate with your project mentors during GSoC (community bonding period & coding period).  What formats are you able to use: virtual check-in meetings, Slack, GitHub issue, email?
* Is there anything your mentors should know about your previous committments, other work schedule, or studies during GSoC that you'll need to work around during GSoC?  How do you plan to honor these committments while also completing your GSoC project?  Please provide this info to ensure your mentors are aware and can be most effective in supporting you.
