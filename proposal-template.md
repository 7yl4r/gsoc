#  Title 

## Abstract

Short description of your project, 5-10 sentences.
Please **DO NOT** copy the project idea text here!

## Why this project?

Why you want to do this GSoC project and our organizaiton?
Note that this part is **very** important to show your motivation!

## Technical Details

More detailed description of your project.
**Should** include all technical details of the projects for example:
- the libraries involved,
- the languages and techniques you will use,
- some pieces of the code you want to change,
-  links to literature you used during the research,
-  etc.

Here it is important to show if you had previous conversations with your mentors.

## Development Experience

Do you have code on GitHub?
Can you show previous contributions to other projects?
Did you do other code related projects or university courses?

## Schedule of Deliverables

Here you should list your milestones.
This list is a start based on the phases of GSoC.
You can/should add more details for each phase by breaking it down into weeks or set specific targets for each phase.
Each target should be split into sub task with a time estimate.

### **Community Bonding Period**

This phase is to get to know the community better and to prepare to start working on your project once the coding period begins.
Check that your work environment is set up, and that you can access all the necessary code, data, or other prerequisites for your project.
This time should also be used to discuss your project in more detail with your mentors and, with their assistance, introduce it to the broader developer community. 

IOOS offers several options for you to engage with our developer and data manager community (see details in the [README](https://github.com/ioos/gsoc/blob/main/README.md)).  Please consider joining one of our virtual communication forums during the community bonding periord, or, if possible, participating in the [2024 IOOS Code Sprint](https://ioos.github.io/ioos-code-sprint/2024/) (virtual attendance available).  

### **Phase 1**

Deliverables

### **Phase 2**

Deliverables

### **Final Week**

At this stage you should finish up your project, and make sure that you have code submitted to your organization.

*Note:* We require any accepted student projects to produce a final writeup summarizing your work.  Ideally, this can be posted directly on GitHub in markdown (.md) format on either a student's fork of a code repository, or in some cases in the source repository itself.  Other options include posting a blog post to a site such as Medium, or similar, where content is likely to remain available for future reference.  See our past GSoC project results pages from [2021](https://github.com/ioos/gsoc/blob/main/2021/project-results.md) and [2022](https://github.com/ioos/gsoc/blob/main/2022/project-results.md) for examples of student writeups.  

## Additional Background

Please also provide brief answers to the following questions: 
* what are your goals for participating in GSoC in relation to your career or future studies?
* what is your preferred method to communicate with your project mentors during the coding period (virtual check-in meetings, Slack, GitHub issue, email)?
* is there anything your mentors should know about your work schedule or studies during GSoC to ensure they can be most effective in supporting you?
